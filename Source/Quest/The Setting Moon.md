Canis Hysteria will add a new lore book to the world called "The Rite of the Wolf-Giver". It will explain to the Player that there are two main strains of the lycanthrope disease: Sanies Lupinus and Canis Hysteria. Canis Hysteria (or "wild lycanthropy") is contracted when someone comes in too close of contact with a lycanthrope whereas Sanies Lupinus can only be conferred via magical means, such as a curse. It is also mentioned that the difference between these two strains is not well understood by most and they are often misattributed by one another's name. Include a brief mention that the name of the strains are determinate of the type of lycanthrope it is. Werebears are Ursus Hysteria and Sanies Ursinus, werelions are Felis Hysteria and Sanies Felinis, ect.

Both diseases have a three-day incubation period that will end with the infected person becoming a full lycanthrope (although if the blood of a lycanthrope is conconsumed directly the transformation will be immediate). Curing either strain is as easy as drinking a "Cure Disease" potion during the incubation period, but after the infected person becomes a full lycanthrope curing the condition becomes substinally harder.

Canis Hysteria can be cured by undergoing an ancient rite performed by a witch of the Glenmoril Wyrd. The rite is shrouded in msytery, but it is said that a coven offered the cure to denezins of Solstheim during the Bloodmoon Prophecies. On the other hand, the only known cure for Sanies Lupinus is to reverse the magical effects from the original source.

The Rite of the Wolf-Giver can be found in leveled lists as well as a few static locations: 

**Ill Met by Moonlight Locations**

[Bloated Man's Grotto](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloated_Man%27s_Grotto)\
[Falkreath Barracks](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Falkreath_Barracks)

**Silver Hand Dungeons**

[Driftshade Refuge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Driftshade_Refuge)\
[Dustman's Cairn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dustman%27s_Cairn)\
[Gallows Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gallows_Rock)

If you are a Companion Werewolf or uninfected the book will simply be a book. However, if you are infected with Canis Hysteria it will trigger a misc quest to find the Wyrd Witches at the [Altar of Thrond](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Altar_of_Thrond) on Solstheim.

Upon traveling to the Altar of Thrond you will find that the Wyrd Witches have since become Hagravens and will attack you. Upon killing them you will find a note on [Ettiene](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ettiene)'s body. Upon reading the note the misc objective will be completed and "The Setting Moon" quest will begin.

The note will detail the process of performing the Rite of the Wolf-Giver.

The first thing that the play will need to do is obtain one [Canis Root](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Canis_Root) and one [Taproot](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Taproot). Once they get those ingredients they will need to remove the heart from the [Sacrifice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sacrifice) (already present) on the Altar of Thrond at the exterior of the cave.

They will then need to take the ingredients and heart to a cauldron inside the cave. The Player will activate the cauldorn and the ingredients and heart will be removed and replaced with a Heart of the Wolf.

Then the Player will need to go back to the sacrifice and place the Heart of the Wolf into their inventory. Upon doing that a wolf spirit will spawn next to the Player and they will need to fight it off. 

One the spirit has been defeated the Player's wild lycanthropy will be cured.

If the Player accepts Companion lycanthropy while this quest is active, they will fail it.
